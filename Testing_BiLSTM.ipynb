a kind of clone of josef von sternberg). amiel breaks with shields as a result, and never will work for him again. however, amiel is able within a few years to be one of the most successful hollywood directors anyway.<br /><br />that incident was in 1936 (a film preview is shown at a theater showing anna karenina with garbo and fredric march - an mgm film, just like this one). in 1941 shields is casting the leading role for a film to be shot by harry whitfield (leo g. carroll - possibly a clone of alfred hitchcock). he decides to hire \\\\\"georgia lorison\\\\\" (lana turner) for the female lead opposite \\\\\"gaucho\\\\\" (gilbert roland). lorison is the daughter of a classic leading actor of the past (his voice is heard - it is louis calhern\\'s), who died impoverished and an alcoholic wreck (the father and daughter are supposed to be john and diane barrymore). georgia is trying to keep off the sauce herself, and falls on the day shooting is to begin. since jonathan learns that georgia loves him, he romances her. it is only when the film is in the can that he breaks it off, rather roughly. georgia\\'s performance makes her a success in hollywood, but she never will work for jonathan again.<br /><br />finally we have the story of novelist james lee barlow (dick powell) and his wife rosemary (gloria grahame). barlow is in hollywood to write the screenplay version of his best selling novel of the deep south (he\\'s a clone for william faulkner and thomas wolfe, with some f.scott fitzgerald in). as rosemary keeps james lee from working, jonathan tries to get the author into isolation to work, and preoccupies rosemary with gaucho (who had come onto her at a party). but gaucho and rosemary are killed in a plane crash. james lee finishes the script, but an argument between jonathan and von ellstein causes the latter to quit the film. jonathan ruins the film because he has no talent as a director. still he and james lee might work on a new project together, but a stupid remark by jonathan causes james lee to realize that gaucho and rosemary were together on that ill-fated trip due to jonathan. so he too leaves the producer. but subsequently he writes a novel about his wife, and wins a pulitzer prize.<br /><br />called together by jonathan\\'s financial head, harry pebble (walter pidgeon), the three victims of shields refuse a new offer for just one final picture with him. but at the conclusion they all show curiosity on just what the new idea of his is.<br /><br />the bad and the beautiful had a wonderful script - it has many intricate bits in it that one has to catch on repeated viewings. pebble (originally shields\\' boss) dismisses him until he sees the treatment of the novel that amiel wrote - he thinks it is shields\\' ideas). he says in front of a seething fred amiel he always thought shields a genius. later, of course, he realizes it was not jonathan\\'s work. similarly von ellstein congratulates jonathan on being the first producer whose treatment of a book resembles the work of a director. later he too realizes it was fred\\'s work, and ironically the collapse of jonathan\\'s position is begun when von ellstein lectures jonathan on how you can\\'t just stuff a film with a series of climaxes but have to build to one. also the first time georgia and james lee discuss a film script they accidentally (by lack of knowledge on his part, and by temporary failure of memory on hers) hurt each other without realizing it. it becomes a rich tapestry of the industry and the various lives that get involved in it. as such it is one of the best films about movie making ever made.\"',\n",

              " 'decades ago, a crate filled with weapons grade plutonium crashes on an island and soaks into the ground. today, a team of military men are sent to track down a notorious terrorist (of ambiguous national origin) and they track him to this polluted island. when their raft is destroyed, the team must spend the night on shore, but soon discover that the plutonium has done something awful to the island -- it has called forth hundreds of bloodthirsty velociraptors.<br /><br />let me start this with a lesson: don\\'t lend a movie to your friend before you\\'ve seen it, especially if you are supposed to be reviewing it for the internet\\'s finest horror movie site. it took me almost a year to get this film back, and the person who borrowed it still had not watched it (though we ended up seeing it together). and a second, more important, lesson: when you do watch this, keep your expectations as low as humanly possible. because this film ranks among the worst i\\'ve ever seen.<br /><br />my acting in 8th grade was more convincing than the seasoned actors who appear in this film (lorenzo lamas, stephen bauer). line delivery is very fake, and the words themselves are poorly scripted. the opening words come from a man checking out his gun\\'s scope: \\\\boom. dead bad guys.\\\\\" yes, that\\'s pure genius at work. the only conversation with any depth has two main characters explaining their histories. but it, too, seems unnatural and a poor attempt to provide character background and to fill time. we didn\\'t need to know anything about their histories, so why bore us with it? and if you think the conversations are bad, you ain\\'t seen nothing yet.<br /><br />the lighting is atrocious. i generally don\\'t notice lighting, but my friend (a former film school student) was practically vomiting in rage at the way more often than not shadows fell on the actors\\' faces and the light would be in the background, focused on nothing in particular. most lighting looks like a spotlight in a dim room, and many of the scenes involve a deep, subterranean cavern -- which you\\'d then expect to be poorly lit, but had lights coming from all sorts of random angles. don\\'t ask me why.<br /><br />the plot was pretty bad. some films can take the idea of military men chasing a terrorist and make a convincing film out of it. cat and mouse stories are riveting. well, not here. the terrorist is really not even part of the story, just an excuse to go to the island. and the raptors? and the allosaurus? sure, they came from the plutonium that soaked into the ground. but if that makes sense to you, please explain it to me because i have no clue how radiation brings dinosaurs back from millions of years of extinction.<br /><br />by far the worst part of \\\\\"raptor island\\\\\" is the animation of the raptors. that\\'s right -- the selling point of the film is the worst aspect. the animation isn\\'t just bad, it\\'s subpar. i can\\'t even express the hilarity of cartoons this cheesy. and when they get shot? red splats like one would see in an old video game. even the airplane, helicopter and navy ship are cartoons... how hard is it to get a model plane? please don\\'t see \\\\\"raptor island\\\\\" unless you need a good laugh or want to get sickeningly drunk. sure, you probably want to see it before you see \\\\\"raptor island 2\\\\\" (which seems to be getting better reviews). but just avoiding it entirely is your best bet. the closest thing i can compare it to is \\\\\"pinata: survival island\\\\\", and unfortunately this film makes the pinata look good by comparison. you have been warned.\"',\n",

how their services would be utilized has piqued my curiosity for some time. the glittering line-up features amitabh bachchan in the title role, along with chopra regulars saif ali khan, sunjay dutt, the exquisite vidya balan, boman irani, parikshat sahni, jackie shroff, jimmy sher gill, raima sen, and an elegant cameo by sharmila tagore.<br /><br />the film opens with the unmistakable voice of amitabh bachchan narrating the legend of eklavya from the hindu epic, the mahabharata. eklavya, a child of undistinguished antecedents yearns to study archery under the tutelage of dronacharya, the instructor of kings. contemptuous of his low birth, dronacharya refuses to accept eklavya as a student. undeterred, eklavya builds a clay effigy of dronacharya and ceaselessly practices archery before it. soon after, dronacharya is taken aback by eklavya\\'s proficiency, which has outstripped that of his princely pupils. as it wouldn\\'t do for this commoner\\'s skills to rival those of the royalty, the crafty dronacharya demands a \\\\\"dakshina\\\\\" or teacher\\'s fee from eklavya. whatever you wish, the devoted lad replies. your right thumb--that is what i want as my \\\\\"dakshina\\\\\", commands dronacharya. without hesitation, eklavya slices off the thumb, knowing full well it would end his prowess in archery. the story is meant to illustrate the notion of \\\\\"dharma\\\\\" or the fulfillment of one\\'s sacred duty in any circumstance, regardless of cost. off screen, the child to whom amitabh recounts the story protests this outcome, and his shrill tones are the voice of reason.<br /><br />amitabh, like his dutiful namesake eklavya, is the loyal manservant and bodyguard of a line of minor royalty in rajasthan. despite the family\\'s tyrannical ways, he unswervingly stands by them. the film unfolds in the present, but this particular royal family still resides in a fog of past glory, entitlement, and unquestioned power. their continuing nastiness has made the natives restless, and the worm is about to turn.<br /><br />the queen mother\\'s (sharmila tagore) deathbed revelation sets the somewhat baroque, overwrought plot in motion. the heir apparent (saif ali khan), who had earlier fled the principality in disgust at the profligate ways of his relatives, is summoned home for her funeral. before breathing her last, the queen pens a letter to her son spilling the proverbial beans. this confession causes a domino effect of cross and double cross, intrigue and counter-intrigue.<br /><br />the film has the look and feel of a stately epic, but vidhu vinod chopra is not interested in the luxuriant pace associated with epics. there is a business-like economy in his approach. there is no waxing philosophical about the misdeeds that have brought this family to its present ugly impasse. he appears to say that was then, in the past, there\\'s no time for that; let\\'s simply watch how their karmic debts are collected now. voice-overs and numerous brisk flashbacks provide just enough expository detail to follow the events unfolding in the present. the pace is breathless, as though generations of past injustices can wait no longer for expiation. every now and then, there is a moment of stillness, which one wishes would be held a few seconds longer for the mood to be savored. an effective scene on the palace ramparts is reminiscent of the ghostly visitation in \\\\\"hamlet\\\\\", and the wraith, despite no lines to declaim, has similar impact.<br /><br />amitabh bachchan\\'s magisterial performance as a man programmed for blind duty, having to suddenly distinguish between obligation and reason transcends the silliness of the plot. saif ali khan impresses yet again; there is maturity and depth in his performance as the conflicted prince with the populist conscience. unlike \\\\\"parineeta\\\\\", vidya balan doesn\\'t have a whole lot to do here, but is dignified and graceful in her few scenes as the commoner in love with a prince. boman irani, an actor of sweeping range and intelligence, is a hoot with his hissy fits and sloe-eyed ambiguity, while jackie shroff and jimmy sher gill, as the wicked uncle and cousin, handle the villainy with lip-smacking gusto. sunjay dutt, fresh off his munnabhai success, is a welcome presence as the investigating police officer with little patience for the anachronisms of fiefdoms and effete royalty. what a pleasure it is to see sharmila tagore, who retains her looks and glamor despite the passage of the years.<br /><br />\\\\\"eklavya\\\\\" displays a most un-indian efficiency (in film-making terms, at least) and speed (a mere 105 minutes) in telling its tale that had me longing for a little more of some of the characters. it would be interesting to see just how much of the film was left on the editing room floor\\x85perhaps the dvd will have the deleted scenes. music is used appropriately: there is a lone song, of which only a judicious snatch is used on screen. the cinematography makes full use of the gorgeous rajasthani terrain, with its pitiless crags and sun-scorched sands. clearly, vidhu vinod chopra has an eye on international audiences for his film, and glowing endorsements from the likes of ralph fiennes enhance his chances. here\\'s to you, mr. chopra, and more power to you.\"',\n",
              " \"black robe (1991) <br /><br />released with poor timing in the aftermath of a similar themed film - kevin costner's dances with wolves - black robe largely got lost in the shuffle. that's a shame, because the film is actually quite remarkable. not to say that it hasn't had influence on other films however. black robe certainly must have had quite an influence on terrence malick and his the new world. the title credits are clearly inspired by those in black robe, and other aspects are familiar as well.<br /><br />set in 17th century quebec, the film follows a young jesuit priest, father lafourgue (bluteau), referred to as black robe by the natives. he travels with a band algonquins lead by chomina (schellenberg). with father lafourgue is daniel, a young frenchman, who is in love with chomina's daughter. the young priest soon begins to inspire fears that he is some sort of demon, and many in the band wish to leave him behind, or possibly even kill him and his companion.<br /><br />their travels meet turmoil among other hostile native tribes, leading not only a struggle between peoples, but a struggle between faiths. beresford creates a very bleak atmosphere, using the cold quebec landscape as an intimidating, but still beautiful backdrop. the weather feels cold, the air crisp. it's really quite a beautiful film to look at.<br /><br />bruce moore, who wrote the screenplay and the novel it was based on, went to great lengths in research to accurately portray this period in time. many have praised the film for its accuracies, while a number of others have however complained that it shows natives as savages. i have to disagree. neither side is shown as total bad guys, nor total good guys. the film gives everyone a fair shake. both sides have/had their reasons, and both sides committed terrible acts. certainly, not all natives were all about peace and love, which is not a slight to them in the least. their history is a noble one, and they had every right to fear and be hostile in the face of europeans. that said, i'm probably overcompensating for the film, because it really doesn't show natives as savages at all, especially not the algonquins. moore claimed, in fact, that he actually toned down the violence of the natives compared to what he found in his research. that said, what he found in his research was most likely overstated to begin with.<br /><br />black robe certainly is a bleak picture. the naturalistic photography and tone adds to the depressed atmosphere. this is not a story of joys, but of sorrows. when the film ends, we are told what history has already told us - the natives were slaughtered and the jesuit's mission by and large was a futile failure.<br /><br />though the film sticks to its own dark history, this is more than just a very well done history lesson. black robe is a parable of the horrifying results that come from misunderstanding, miscommunication, and ignorance. while the jesuit mission was well intentioned, it was more a product of eurocentric ignorance than anything else. the native people had their own religious beliefs, and the film shows that. the lessons in black robe are transferable to any number of modern day conflicts. we have not learned our lesson, and by removing the gloss and glamour off the period epics of old, black robe serves as a reminder. such a shame its so overlooked.\",\n",

              " \"despite the title, this film is not about a crime wave. that's just a catchy title to start you wondering. it is about a reformed ex-convict, well played by gene nelson, being pressured by some escaped cons to assist them, thus endangering his parole and threatening his wife, ably portrayed by phyllis kirk. the film is dominated by the massive six foot five noir star, sterling hayden, as a tough homicide cop who chews toothpicks non-stop because his doctors won't let him smoke, and who says things like: 'you're head's full of mush.' it's always good to see sterling hayden again, the more times he turns up the better; he's solid, he's menacing, and what is more, he's the real thing. you know he'd knock you down and then pick you up again, and besides, he's compulsively watchable. in his eyes there is always that half-mad flicker, and that ain't acting. the film is directed with superb applomb by the highly professional andre de toth, lucky spouse of the delicious veronica lake, and he never wasted a frame. there are numerous fine touches: sterling hayden picks up a murdered cop's hat and puts it in the ambulance beside his corpse, but he does this as as afterthought without calling attention to the gesture. in one scene, a crowd of extras stand on the far side of the street watching a police raid. toth allows them merely to be glimpsed. toth does not signal and linger, he moves on, he has the confidence and control not to worry. there is lots of los angeles as it was in 1952 in this film (released only in 1954). all those fifties people, all those fifties cars, all those fifties shops. where have they all gone? this picture has action all the way, gene nelson and phyllis kirk do not sleep in twin beds, things are brutal and quick, but there is no excess of violence. the film is primarily a psychological tension drama, as all true noir must be. noir is about doubt, insecurity, pressure, and threats all around you, with betrayal and trust as the key issues. oh yes, and there's love too, which generally takes place between the bullets rather than between the sheets. (no one in a noir film has time to go to bed without being interrupted by a threatening phone call or someone banging on the door. you grab a kiss as you make a run for it.)\",\n",

              " 'who knows out of what strange game of fate or as if the universe conspired upon its creation and everything that came to pass did so that tobe hooper would make the texas chainsaw massacre. like a blood spattered, low-budget orson welles of 70\\'s exploitation, the immensity of his debut will forever haunt him and his career.<br /><br />the task of committing tcm to words is a difficult one, not because the proper words don\\'t exist but merely because they can only describe the surface and never convey the essence and the heart and what can only be felt in one\\'s own skin and maybe that of others. sounds of animals and howling of beasts and the clanking of rustling metal speak tcm\\'s language. the dissonant chord that sounds in the soundtrack as the movie fades from black to flashes of decaying flesh is tcm\\'s lingo and what defines it is disorientation.<br /><br />indeed the first shot proper that opens the movie, that of a rotten head and as the camera zooms out we see the whole dead body in a grotuesque posture like some sort of zombified jester sitting atop a gravestone, offers no clue and safe grip for the viewer. after the opening credits roll, we are served an orange sun burning in a blackened sky and that dissolves into the image of a dead armadillo laying on the street. we\\'re 5 minutes into the movie and we\\'re provided no clues of typical genre orientation, no protagonists of any sort. as the eye scans the image for something to cling to, narrative or otherwise, there\\'s nothing there save for decay and death.<br /><br />and then tcm starts rolling and picks up steam and never stops. apart from how original or not the concept is (crazed backwoods family terrorizing city kids) it\\'s the approach that makes all the difference. hooper achieves sensory terror and doom by piling on images and sounds, each of them spilling to the next frame starting an avalanche of horror. a close shot of cattles as the van drives in the background, a seedy gas station, a crazed hitch-hiker the kids pick up, an abandoned house. in the interior shots of the abandoned house the blacks are crushed and we only see silhouettes moving against the textures in the walls and those are juxtaposed with exterior shots where the whites wash out, like some kind of rural hell, a land of some other order that is coming apart under the weight of its own abandonment.<br /><br />even when the sensory chaos is broken for a while so that our genre expectations can be fulfilled as the crippled guy franklin mutters to a couple that leaves the abandoned house to make out \\\\yeah, see you in an hour or so\\\\\" (followed by a drone in the score) and we just know he\\'s never gonna see them again, a typically ominous foreshadowing common in slashers, that only lasts for seconds. then hooper cuts back to puzzling images, feathers on the ground and some kind of dreamcatcher made of bone (?) and weird buzzing sounds in the score, like otherwordly insects flying unseen. tcm constantly tips its own axis, content to be left out of balance.<br /><br />the first encounter with notorious chainsaw-wielding leatherface is as disorienting as anything that comes before it. he appears out of nowhere like a beast in a frenzy and the carnage begins. and for a movie of tcm\\'s reputation there is surprisingly no (or at least little) explicit gore. yet the violence is startling and raw as the images that preceed its outburst spill into it and add their own touch of the morbid. eisenstein must have been clairvoyant when he spoke of how powerful montage can be.<br /><br />we\\'re also given glimpses to leatherface\\'s tortured, crazed soul, bits of characterization like a gesture and a look of his eyes. not a psycho killer out of sadistic pleasure perhaps, he looks more like a savage beast defending its territory or a wild dog scared of intruders trespassing in his nest.<br /><br />like an avalanche of macabre images that is impossible to stop once it starts, tcm whizzes by in a manic pace. the chase scene where leatherface hunts down marilyn burns, scared out of her wits and howling like a wounded animal, is shot through branches of trees, as if the landscape is conspiring to ensnare the victim and so hunter and hunted run in the fields and inside a house and then back outside while the titular chainsaw is buzzing away in a constant reminder of gruesome death. even when hooper overplays his hand (as in the dinner scene) it\\'s all done with deliberation that cannot be ignored, like maybe the director is as insane as the characters he\\'s depicting and he takes great pleasure in basking in their insanity.<br /><br />tcm simply has to be experienced, no critical analysis can do it justice. without bucketloads of gore, without the slick look of high budget, it remains one of the most bleak, atmospheric and aurally violent movies of all time. what happened to tobe hooper\\'s career after it is anyone\\'s guess, but tcm is good enough to top entire filmographies of other directors. it has been imitated countless times, remade and given sequels and prequels to, but there\\'s something primeval about the original that can\\'t be recaptured.\"',\n",
              " 'another year, another swedish public-service christmas spectacle. every year around christmas svt has a new \\\\big\\\\\" production to show, and every year it feels at least a little bit disappointing. and as far as these go, \\\\\"snapphanar\\\\\" has to be one of the worst in recent years.<br /><br />what shocks me most about this production is undoubtedly the incredibly low level of ambition. it\\'s always easier for me to forgive a movie when it aims for the stars and fail. \\\\\"snapphanar\\\\\" barely aims for the tree-line it seems, and still it disappoints. maybe it\\'s a sign of extremely low self-esteem in swedish public-service?<br /><br />the strange thing is that on the surface this production is not that bad. the visuals are pretty good, the production values are not bad for a (in international perspective) low-budget production. but under the cracks in the surface you can see how shallow it is. here we see the low ambition that i mentioned earlier. historical facts are fabricated, changed or just simply ignored. and the script seems to be written by a ten-year-old. the plot is simplistic, the \\\\\"twists\\\\\" can be seen a mile away and the story itself is uninteresting and bland. as a theme the story about \\\\\"snapphanar\\\\\" could be interesting. it\\'s (as far as i know) a rather unique thing in swedish history. a partisan group wanting to make the shire \\\\\"skåne\\\\\" part of denmark instead of sweden, fighting armed battle for their cause. but the whole premise is squandered here by poor writing and non-existent regard for historical facts. also the fact that these partisan rebels seem to be a gang completely inane idiots doesn\\'t help. they are portrayed like a bunch of stumbling do-gooders completely without fighting skill, making it very clear why skåne is still swedish today.<br /><br />well, how about entertainment value? sometimes a decent entertainment value on the surface can save even the most shallow movie. not in this case though i\\'m afraid. there are just too many things to be annoyed about even if you don\\'t think to closely about what you\\'re watching. the incomprehensible accents (sounding like the skåne-dialect mixed with danish and a tinge of retardation), the \\\\\"le pacte des loups\\\\\"-inspired fighting scenes that lack energy, and the names and dialog that makes you laugh at the most inappropriate moments. directors mårlind and stein have a distinctive hollywood-complex that also shines through in a disturbing way.<br /><br />i don\\'t know how much \\\\\"snapphanar\\\\\" cost to produce. it looks more expensive than most standard swedish tv-fare but since it was made in estonia it was probably quite cheap. no matter though since this was definitely a case of very little bang for your buck. i just wonder when swedish tv and film-makers will understand that a good and solid script is the base in every good movie. when they understand that and hire someone decent to write the script (instead of burning their money on fight-scenes filmed from three angles), then maybe this could be entertainment rather than just a bland and boring waste of money and time.\"',\n",

(a clever use of the visual medium; as the inclusion of any title cards would be considered strictly passé and a throwback to the days of the silent movies.) for all of the magnificent scientific marvels that were embodied in the invention of the giant metal robots, the mad scientist is concerned only in looting bank vaults, pillaging jewelry establishments and repelling attacks from tommy gun wielding uniformed coppers. perhaps this is due to poor pay, working conditions and lack of employment opportunities for brilliant, albeit mad scientists that they are forced to supplement their meager incomes through such unlawful means.<br /><br />furthermore no one ever has truly explained just what makes these eggheads so \\'mad\\', anyhow! all kidding aside, the short is fast moving, well plotted and rendered in such a manner as to be an animated equivalent of a museum quality painting from one of the dutch masters.

              " 'this was one of the most dishonest, meaningless, and non-peaceful of the films i have ever seen. the representation of the other, of the israelis, was racist, backward, and unfair. for one, the song played on e.s\\' car radio when pulled up alongside a very right-wing israeli driver was \\\\i put a spell on you\\\\\" by natacha atlas. the song\\'s style is quite arabic, but it was released on an israeli compilation cd, and i have even heard it on the radio in israel. many israeli songs (as well as architecture, foods, and slang) are influenced by arabic culture, and there is no reason an israeli jew would be offended or angered by a nearby car playing that song. the way e.s. appears so calm and collected with his sunglasses and cool glare, via a long, still shot, is meant to force the viewer into seeing the jew as haggard and racist, and e.s. as noble and temperate.<br /><br />i have traveled all over israel, and i have never seen an idf recruitment poster, since service is mandatory. but in the film, not only is there a recruitment poster, but it depicts a stereotypical image of an arab terrorist and the words \\\\\"want to shoot?\\\\\" this is an extremely inaccurate depiction of the mentality of the majority of israelis as well as israeli soldiers, and such an \\\\\"advertisement\\\\\" wouldn\\'t even exist on a random israeli highway. in including it, the director aims to convince the audience that israel is a society of anti-arab racists hell-bent on murder.<br /><br />the ninja scene was gratuitous and needlessly violent. a hollywood-style action scene involving israeli soldiers shooting palestinians would be just as unwelcome in an israeli-directed film as the ninja scene should have been. but for some reason, images of an unrealistic, non-comic, and violent scenario manage to elicit applause from the audience since the director has smeared the israeli side so much beforehand, that any shot of israeli soldiers being killed would be welcome. the director shows absolutely no attempt at building bridges, portraying the \\\\\"other\\\\\" as human, or working towards peace; violence is made to be the only solution. this is furthered by scenes of exploding tanks, falling guard towers, and other random acts of destruction. one of my best friends serves in the israeli military, and the targets in firing ranges are never arab women dressed in black, or any other quasi-civilian on canvas. soldiers at checkpoints are instructed not to fire at the head of an approaching palestinian unless it is clear that their own lives are in danger; the method, according to my friend, is to provide a warning shout, fire into the air or around the area, and then if all else fails, shoot in the leg and then interrogate and hospitalize. arbitrarily targeting a woman in the head, as shown in the film, is not the proper procedure.<br /><br />besides these inaccuracies, the directing style was also poor. repetition became repetitious, and no longer captivating. symbols, such as the balloon with arafat drawn on it, are forced outside any plot structure or effective integration in the setting; the balloon is palestine penetrating and regaining jerusalem, and it is created for no reason by e.s. the ambulance being checked for permits by israeli soldiers followed by subsequent israeli ambulances flying past the checkpoint is an overly-overt claim of an israeli double standard by the director. the attempt by the director to show life in nazareth as dreary and pointless is done with overkill; showing the routines of random people over and over again, even with a slight change each time, and emphasizing that not one member of the cast ever smiles and is minimalist in dialogue almost screams out the purpose of such scenes, the dreariness of life, without allowing much room for personal interpretation. by contrasting one \\\\\"section\\\\\" of the movie, daily life in nazareth, with the second section, the checkpoint between ramallah and israel, the director subtly blames this dreariness on israel, but never provides any direct evidence as to why such blame can be properly argued.<br /><br />i spent hours trying to figure out why music ended abruptly and began abruptly, and why many modern fashion-show-like and metal-action tracks were included in the score. i still cannot come up with an answer. i felt that the music was out of place in this film; the contrast between more silent scenes and intense scenes was actually annoying and not affecting or thought-provoking. i can understand if the director intended for the music to provide some comic aspect to certain scenes, but i found that there was nothing comic to be found in israeli soldiers shooting at targets or fighting a ninja, or a woman having to suffer another walk through a checkpoint, albeit defiantly. in fact, i was tempted to close my ears during intense scenes, and annoyed by the lack of a score during quiet scenes. whatever the director\\'s intent, it provided only an audial displeasure throughout the film.<br /><br />this film has no legitimate political message because it provides an inaccurate and extreme representation of the other, and neglects to actually address any issues. it is a propaganda film, because the director intends various symbols, styles, and scenes to draw sympathy for the palestinian side, while displaying the israeli side as cruel and inhuman without exception; the vibrant atmosphere of an action-packed hollywood scene or of intense music is displayed in every act of violence by palestinians against israelis, such that the almost inevitably positive and thrilled feelings the music and cinematography elicit from the audience are directed to one side. there is no thought, reflection, or deepening of the understanding of the conflict by the audience; emotions are simply pulled to one side, and kept there, in a \\\\\"good vs bad\\\\\" cliché scenario. i believe this film lacked the depth, quality, and power of other palestinian films, such as \\\\\"paradise now\\\\\" and \\\\\"wedding in the galilee.\\\\\"\"',\n",

              " \"firstly, some reviewer has claimed the events of the movie are dated to 1789. it is wrong. by that time diderot was already dead (1713-1784). the year 1789 appears in the beginning of the movie as a date of french revolution to which diderot was a kind of forerunner. the right dating seems to be 1750's, when diderot should have been about his 40, as it comes also from his daughter age and from boucher's painting, which the company views during the sideshow in the end of the movie. this painting was executed in about 1752. <br /><br />now despite all these historical correspondences, the viewer must understand - this movie is not about diderot's real life, it is a fantasy, which includes personage named denis diderot, who in some instances has some common features with historical person denis diderot. <br /><br />now, when you come to see the movie, try to forget all you know (if you do) about the real diderot and just enjoy the jokes, the funny situations and delightful absurdities of the movie. if you'll do this, you will really love the film. to some sever judges i would suggest reading rabelais. humor is a special genre, with its special rules and demands, and most important, with a lot of very diverse faces. you can not evaluate it departing from your personal ideology, philosophy or whatever, you should concern it in its own terms and believe me, such are exist. <br /><br />le libertin is a light and wonderfully filmed comedy. it leaves you with a kind smile on your lips when the last frame makes its place to titles and a strong wish to watch it again immediately. <br /><br />the cast is incredible, especially fanny ardant who (as she always do) manages to create truly complex personage. <br /><br />nudity is natural, not hidden, not shaming - in a painful contrast with puritan hollywood. the same is true regarding the matters of sexuality. <br /><br />gabriel aghion made a good job, and thanks to le libertin, pédale douce and belle maman i am ready to forget his disastrous pédale dure. <br /><br />really recommended to anyone who is ready to open his mind to things that may be not exactly of his style.\",\n",

it\\'s true that films like zodiac, blood diamond and apocalypto occupy my top three of 2007 but even some of them and the many others on that list do not match the fondness and recognition that i had for dead man\\'s shoes upon seeing it \\x96 the great thing is, this was extensively levelled down in terms of funding but pumped up in terms of quality. make no mistake, dead man\\'s shoes is very good.<br /><br />i suppose in order to identify this film, i\\'d have to borrow from america somewhat but that is no shame; this film is 1988\\'s rain man meets a hard as nails, gritty revenge film \\x96 perhaps something staring james cagney in his pomp. but it is a revenge film with an air of indifference; the film is often funny, often touching and often heart-warming in its portrayal of inept small time crooks, its nasty flashbacks of bullying and its small inclusion of scenes in which someone with special needs is present and displaying his innocence. while i have only seen the rather underwhelming once upon a time in the midlands from director shane meadows, this isn\\'t so much as a jolt back in the right direction as it is a full blown shove back onto the correct tracks. meadows directs and unfolds his story in a brilliant manner but in a manner that utilises so many techniques that we the audience flip from happy to sad to anger to disgust and in such a way that we have time to appreciate what we\\'re seeing; feeling and what we think of it all.<br /><br />paddy considine plays richard, a soldier fresh back from, what i can only assume to be, the horrors of iraq and the iraq war going on. but where road side bombs and ambushes have been erased, richard is psychologically stuck with constant explosions going off in his mind \\x96 anger, rage, sadness and that lust for revenge when he learns his younger, more simple brother has suffered torment and bullying at the hands of the local drug dealers and young adults who have not matured enough to shake off that \\'chav\\' mentality. needless to say, he brings home the horrors of iraq with him in all their bloody infamy in what could be one of the best post-war syndrome studies since travis bickle in taxi driver. the film poster of said film on someone\\'s flat wall perhaps hints at this.<br /><br />but apart from the horror and the tragedy, which does grab you thanks to some flashbacks that i eventually came to fear popping up, everything is revealed in a satisfying and balanced way. initially, the users of the boy call him over and tap him on the back and invite him in and everything seems very harmless; we even think he is close enough to these people to go out and get some groceries for them if nothing else is on. but whatever we thought is quickly presented to us over and over in a, frankly, quite brilliant piece of directing and pacing as we realise these people are not what they are cracked up to be. further utilisation of the kid follows; then it gets more serious when drugs and women come into play. meadows also gets across the element of humour early on in his film; indeed, when you see herbie (wolfenden) trundle down the road in his citroen 2cv with the other guys in the back, you cannot help but smirk at how real this all feels; at how these people are presented as people who live, breath, hang around in apartments and drive obscure cars.<br /><br />but then again, you get the feeling of disturbance. we are not aware of the true extent of things until much later but looking back at the events in the opening hour, the leisurely way in which the gang hang around and talk about nothing in particular considering what they have done is shocking. meadows also gets across his feeling of foreboding and the sense its all building up to something. richard\\'s initial work that he carries out on the gang all feels as if it builds up to the big showdown with the final gang member; the one member we will feel a juxtaposition toward since he has a wife and two children. onto the wrongdoers in question; initially, herbie is introduced but then we get two of his lackey accomplices living in an apartment;

              " 'this review covers both versions of \\\\flatland\\\\\" released in 2007, one by ladd ehlinger, jr. with a mostly unknown voice cast, and the other by jeffrey travis with some hollywood big names providing the voices.<br /><br />the source material for both is the 1884 novella by edwin a. abbott, but the approaches of the two films differ radically. the book is a staple of science fiction, and one of the few to address mathematical issues at its core. being a product of its time, the book is technically naive, and politically incorrect based on current sensibilities.<br /><br />the travis film is visually slicker, but significantly shorter, and tackles philosophical issues relative to the passage of time from initial publication. as such, it tampers with the plot to mixed effect. unlike some others, i have no problem with some of the revisions to the underlying plot since they do help bring some of the book\\'s major issues into somewhat sharper focus. on the other hand, they also add a \\\\\"feel good\\\\\" and politically correct sensibility that seems out of place.<br /><br />the ehlinger film is much truer to its source material, which is both a strength and a weakness. given a current perspective, its 19th century depiction of the political and social subjugation of women is a distraction that the travis film avoids. it\\'s also a longer film and could have been more effective with some of the same plot and editing license employed in the travis film. where it does tamper with the plot, some of the decisions are questionable as other reviewers have pointed out.<br /><br />so which is better? in my opinion, the short answer is the ehlinger film. despite its length, political incorrectness, and technical inferiority (the animation of the travis film is much more sophisticated), it resonates at a technical level to a degree that the travis film can\\'t match. as a scientist, this means a lot to me. on the other hand, the travis film resonates on an emotional level that the ehlinger film can\\'t match. so the answer may be whether you\\'re looking for technical insight or emotional satisfaction.<br /><br />most jarring in the travis film is that, unlike the ehlinger film, the animators never quite caught on to the implications of a two-dimensional universe. it is filled with objects which are instantly recognizable to us, yet would be clearly impossible or meaningless in the film\\'s reality (e.g. the protagonist\\'s daughter has toys which only make sense to someone with a 3-d perspective, and how does he open his briefcase?). the cover art is an obvious first impression example. the travis film\\'s characters look more human, but ask yourself how their eyes work. one detail of the book is that looking at a flatlander from above, all of his internal organs are clearly visible, as they should be. travis\\' animators hint at this, but don\\'t meet it head-on. the ehlinger film\\'s animators may not have had the resources to make as slick a film as travis\\', but they obviously gave a great deal of thought to what they were doing (or maybe not, since the necessary designs were all in the book). in short, travis had the budget, but ehlinger had the passion for the project - albeit perhaps a bit too much respect for the source to create a truly superior adaptation.<br /><br />the differences reflect different target audiences, though. the travis film is an educational short film which was obviously meant to be viewed by classrooms of middle school and high school students. as such, it had to be socially inoffensive while conveying concepts of geometry that would never occur to non-mathematicians. that it includes recognizable names voicing the characters will help it grab a bit more attention - an educational short film for the \\\\\"x-files\\\\\" generation. the ehlinger film would mostly appeal to people with a college level interest in mathematics, or others who are already familiar with the book.<br /><br />neither film is perfect, but i\\'m giving the ehlinger film a rating of 8 and the travis film a rating of 6. depending on your sensibilities, your conclusion may be exactly opposite of mine, so i hope this review includes enough information to guide you to an informed selection.<br /><br />or, like me, you could simply buy both... ;-)\"',\n",

not be human. it doesn't mention the meat of the plot which involves the humans being used in experiment in copulation by some mysterious (and horny) aliens. if it had i mightn't watched it not having acquired a taste for having my sci-fi b-movies spliced with soft core pornography. the presence of real actors such as robert englund and adam baldwin here is a little surprising- okay, they're not hugely respected actors or stars and generally appear in b-movies but i would have though they were both above soft core porn like this.<br /><br />basically 70% of the movie consists of soft core porn scenes or stock footage from other sci-fi and action movies clumsily reinserted into the movie with some pitiful attempts to fit in to the narrative. i didn't realise to now roger croamn was involved. the opening 5 minutes of the movie is a compilation of snippets from different movies clumsily spliced together with a bit of voice over narration- a mixture of space battles, some contemporary war stuff, strip club sequences and what looked like some kind of genetic experimentation and surgery footage. i'm not sure but i think this was meant to indicate the breakdown of civilisation on earth as we know it and/or be the nightmares of the main characters. it is really hard to tell. later on there is a lengthy space battle that clearly came from a different movie awkwardly stuck into the movie in between sex scenes and more of the same footage from the introduction used when the aliens are giving a lecture of the downfall of humanity (which is awfully preachy for a movie like this). each of the characters is given an introduction which seems to consist of snippets from other movies the actor/actresses were in- one guy was clearly in a few kick-boxing movies.<br /><br />basically a bunch of humans, consisting of scientists, soldiers and exotic dancers, wake up on this space ship with no idea of how they got there. they soon meet some aliens, who have taken the form of humans, lead by robert englund who is pretending to be a priest of some sort, who corral them into a breeding experiment, which is basically an excuse for a whole lot of sex. the ostensible reason of this initially is to rebuild the human race but with only 8 people that is going to be one limited gene pool. it is later revealed that the aliens have some plan which involves interbreeding with the humans, i forget why. there is a confused subplot about a faction of the alien dudes wanting to stop the experiment to maintain genetic purity. it makes less sense than you might think as the only alien seen to get down and dirty with the humans is the one who wants to kill them all because her faction is opposed to the interbreeding thing. there is one head scratching scene with her and englund, the only two aliens onboard the ship at this point- the other having been randomly killed by an android (don't ask), in which he explains how he thinks one of them must be from the rival faction but doesn't seem to come to the logical conclusion. given he presumably knows he isn't the guilty party himself it leaves him with a suspect pool of one and he is warning her he knows. i'm generously presuming this is maybe meant to be a warning on the part of englund to alien chick to quit it already rather than the writers for this thing being the dumbest people ever (it brings to mind danny de vito's attempt to write a two character murder mystery in don't throw momma from the train). anyway, there is a whole bunch of screwing, most of the characters die and there are some really bad make effects for the alien transformations and killings- i was starting to fall asleep toward the end of the movie so my memories of the conclusion i kind of hazy.<br /><br />there one or two weird bits of note relating to the alien tech on the ship. you only have to mention what food you want to eat and a plate of that food will instantly appear in your hand. there is a scene in which robert englund orders a plate of meatloaf and mashed potato 'the way his mother made it' and gets it right down to the amount of garlic his mother put in the spuds. other than this one godlike piece of technology none of the rest of the equipment the aliens use is quite as impressive- they can instantly create matter based on the sensory memories in someone's head but only if it is in the form of food. strangely enough nobody else is seen to take advantage of this wonderful device- i guess they were all to busy screwing. the other strange device are these lasers that pop out of the ceiling the second that anyone dies and burn the corpse to dust (leaving the clothing). why, i'm not sure. i'm also not sure why if they have sensors and weaponry that sophisticated they don't just use it as a security system.<br /><br />basically, unless you want to see some generic soft core porn involving adam baldwin intercut with shots of a leering robert englund or you're some kind of sick, sick masochist stay away.\",\n",

              " \"home alone took everyone by surprise when it became the top money-earner of 1990. director chris columbus, writer/producer john hughes and most of the cast and production staff reunited two years later for this sequel, home alone 2: lost in new york. but the cynic in one has to ask, did we really need a sequel to home alone?<br /><br />it feels like everyone has returned because they knew they had a sure-fire hit on their hands rather than any pressing concern to continue this story arc. this was chris columbus' first time directing a sequel, and as expected, he falls into the exact same trap that cripples many a sequel. he fails to do anything different with it.<br /><br />it may have traded in being left at home for the city of new york, but its still the same exact story as last time. kevin mccallister (macaulay culkin, obnoxious as ever) is separated from his family at christmas. he enjoys the freedom to do whatever he wants. until things turn sour. the burglars are back, and just happen to be in new york as well. he sets up another mine field of home-made booby traps for them. the lonely snow-shoveller from pt 1 has been replaced with a lonely pigeon lady. she rescues him. he gets reunited with his family.<br /><br />home alone 2 feels like a much more calculated attempt to recreate the successful elements of home alone. the first was not quite a holiday classic, but it was reasonably successful. due to john hughes' fine screenplay rather than anything on columbus' part. pt 2 sticks to the formula laid out by pt 1 with an almost alarming reverence.<br /><br />it ticks off each situation like a check-list. and i'm afraid the fault for that lies with john hughes. his script has none of the tiny amusements or sharp insights that propelled the first film. he's just copied his own screenplay, and grafted it onto a new setting. i think it was around this point that john hughes sold himself out to hollywood. nowadays he only churns out increasingly formulaic fluff. merely the same concept with whole different actors.<br /><br />chris columbus has also borrowed an idea or two from his debut feature, adventures in babysitting. the story of four kids lost on the streets of chicago one night. that film always seemed like a missed opportunity to me. chris columbus is far too bland as a filmmaker. he played the whole situation too safely, and never really got the best out of it. in fact when i first saw it, i thought if it had been made by john hughes, it could have been a much better film. i was hoping for that with home alone 2, but unfortunately i didn't get it.<br /><br />this is an even greater disappointment. columbus' blandness coupled with hughes' lack of imagination all adds up to a very boring film. home alone 2 never really ignites. it misses the natural warmth and amusing developments of the first film by a mile. there is something almost mechanical to it all. like watching different plot points clicking into place at exact moments. but the one thing that really works against the film is macaulay culkin.<br /><br />home alone got a lot of mileage from young kevin's innocent, wide-eyed view of his predicament. by this point, that innocence has all but gone. culkin's precocity has completely taken over, and now he's just an obnoxious brat we couldn't care less about. its impossible to feel for his plight because he's so unlikable. and having him mouth inane sentiments in a shallow attempt to make him seem wise only irritates. they lack any conviction and hollows out an already empty film.<br /><br />we do get a few amusements from some of the new members of the cast. tim curry gets a few laughs as the manager of the plaza hotel. in a performance seemingly modelled on basil fawlty, his growing suspicion of kevin is pretty funny, even if he's a bit stupid to be suckered in by kevin's tricks. and dana ivey and rob schneider fill out the cast nicely as the equally suspicious (and equally stupid) hotel staff.<br /><br />but nothing else works. there are times when home alone 2 thinks its being really clever, by dropping in knowing references to the first film, in a vain attempt to make you think this is not a rehash. but it is. and its not above reusing the same gags either. we even get another film that kevin uses to dupe people with. which also happens to be a sequel. you can almost imagine chris columbus and john hughes patting themselves on the backs at times like that.<br /><br />of course what people come to see the movie for is harry and marv (joe pesci & daniel stern) going through another of kevin's obstacle courses. but where it proved to be the comic high point of the first film, chris columbus has blown it up to absurd proportions for this one. the traps in pt 1 were at least kept within the boundaries of plausibility, but sadly columbus has thrown all that out the window. its amazing they're still breathing, much less walking after the things they go through this time. they even fall off the top of a building with no apparent after effects. its at this point you realise you're watching the live-action equivalent of a looney tunes cartoon. only not as funny.<br /><br />i don't even want to talk about the improbable, contrived happy ending. home alone 2 is a real stinker. its never as funny as it likes to think it is, or as warm either. its just a pointless sequel that only reveals a blatant calculation at the heart of the enterprise. another bland film from the drab chris columbus, and the start of the sad decline of john hughes' once proud career.\",\n",

              " \"claude chabrol, the french director of many thrillers and dramas and other genres, is at his best when subtly but forcefully pulling the rug out from the viewer. this isn't your usual case of a romance story criss-crossed with a serial killer thriller. in fact, we're not made very much aware that there is a serial killer- save for a few mentions here and there- until halfway through the movie, and by the time we are it's full-throttle in a kind of expertly manipulated suspense, not in the usual sense but through an ominous musical score by pierre jansen and a movement of fluidity with the camera that tells the story sort of conventionally but not at the same time. it's a small, master's class in subverting the genre by making us care so much about the characters even as we know they're doomed from the happy opening.<br /><br />that's not to say that chabrol has made anything that can't be enjoyed by one looking for a good entertaining thriller first and foremost. if anything the opening of the movie is what lures one in perfectly, as it's a very jovial in this wedding sequence one sees guests school-teacher helene (stephane audran, chabrol regular) and butcher paul (jean yanne, perfect as the butcher), enjoying themselves and making good conversation. this stretches out into the first half of the film; a friendship develops around food that paul brings over, and it's only when paul thinks its time to go the 'next step' that he's told it can't be because of a past horrible relationship that helen faced- horrible in the sense of disappointment. there's a disconnect emotionally that is left open, thus, going into the second half of the film, where finally we see what some of us would be waiting for: the serial killer plot.<br /><br />there's a string of murders involving women, and one of them- the bride from the opening- is a shocker not exactly for the revelation itself, per-say, but how chabrol builds up to it. at first it's seen as the most suspenseful thing in the film so far as helen leads her class along a mountainside and stops to have lunch. the music is playing right here, and it's really chilling for how simple it lays out the tension, like a weirdo standing across the street in a black cloak acting suspicious but, at the same time, too subtle to pin down. this adds to the sudden shock, then, after the music stops and finally the reveal happens via blood dripping on the kid's sandwich. this, however, is just one example of chabrol's calm mastery as a director of the material.<br /><br />it would be one thing to go on and on about the eerie absorption of the camera-work, which goes between conventional stylization (for a french film of the period) and poetic editing and framing. or to go on and on about the stunning work turned by audran (going between an entire emotional palette, as it were, from happy to sobbing to frightened to pale and shot to hell) and yanne (also great at what he's meant to be, our male protagonist and, sadly, eventual antagonist by default). but it's the emotional struggle that makes this compelling above all other good reasons to recommend.<br /><br />the butcher posits a relationship that is platonic, naturalistic, and genuinely interesting; these aren't cookie-cutter characters but well-drawn and with things that make them identifiable even as they, early on, seem to go on about trivial things not related to the plot (a little like a woody allen movie). then, when it switches gears bit by bit and the paranoia increases, by the time the climax comes it becomes very, ultimately, tragic. chabrol goes to lengths to reveal, simply, the soul of a man one should not feel any sympathy for. that one close-up in the car ride to the hospital is one of the finest climaxes i might ever see in a movie from europe, even anywhere. and damned if isn't representative of what chabrol can do as a craftier but no less true-to-his-art member of the cashier du cinema filmmaker club. a+\",\n",

              " \"i started watching this movie when syfy broadcast it a few years back, but couldn't get past the scene where the guy's intestines literally fell out of his stomach (not terribly realistic, but still a bit upsetting). however, my curiosity got the better of me, and i did sit through the whole thing when it was on a few weeks back. and it did not fail to disappoint.<br /><br />the story line of this particular offering has to do with a scientist, dr. levering (michael ironside)who has come up with a plan for tapping into geothermal energy to heat manhattan much more cheaply than conventional methods. he has contacted city employee neil kavanaugh (kevin mcnulty), and the two of them are planning on franchising their method and becoming filthy rich. unfortunately, instead of tapping into geothermal energy, levering actually taps into real magma, which starts cropping up all over manhattan, and wreaking all kinds of havoc. when a crew of employees, lead by matt (costas mandylor), encounters some very suspicious, and deadly, conditions in the tunnels and aqueducts under the city, kavanaugh covers up the real cause. geological services comes in to investigate, and one of the investigators turns out to be matt's ex-wife, susan (alexandra paul). she doesn't believe matt when he says he saw lava in the tunnels. however, as more suspicious, and deadly, events happen, she reconsiders. by this point, however, overzealous agent walters (matthew benedict) has come to investigate, and is convinced that terrorism is afoot. can matt and susan manage to stop the volcano before it obliterates most of new york city? <br /><br />like most disaster plots, this one's full of holes. first off, our geothermal expert just didn't seem to really know anything about geothermal energy. second, the implication for most of the deaths in the tunnel was that somehow the water in the pipes had turned into sulfuric acid, although they don't explicitly say so. however, it's hard to believe that the water would have changed to sulfuric acid without coming into contact with the magma, and if that had happened there would have been a huge steam explosion which would have obliterated most of manhattan anyway. then there was the homeowner who opened the door of his house only to be engulfed by lava. why didn't he smell anything burning, or notice heat coming from the ground, and why would he open a door once he'd burned his hand on the handle? dr. levering is badly burned, and left unconscious when the volcano starts to erupt at the drilling site. how did he get out of there? and what exactly happened to him in the tunnels? was he killed or merely knocked unconscious by the steam emitting from the bullet hole in the tunnel wall. and finally, throughout the movie, people are way to close to lava with no problems caused by the hear or the fumes. all in all, it's a pretty poorly written script.<br /><br />there were some surprisingly decent actors in this movie. michael ironside does a pretty good job as the mad scientist, who just gets crazier and crazier as the movie goes along. mandylor and paul do okay with the material they're given. unfortunately, it's just poorly written, and there's only so much they can do with it. sad to say, the rest of the cast is pretty forgettable.<br /><br />is it too much to ask that the people who pen these movies actually learn something of the science that they're using for their plot devices? if this movie is any indication, i guess so.\",\n",

(see my review of home at seven with ralph richardson where i discuss this psychological issue further.) the general public will just accept all this as 'a bit of hokum', not being aware that such things have actually happened from time to time. however, this is no time to be serious. this film is intended as pure fun. it works because of the magical sparkle between powell and loy, which chiefly owes its magic to powell's remarkable and humorous personality and the unique response to it which seems to have emerged spontaneously from myrna loy from the moment they met. theirs was a cinematic matching made in heaven. the two of them together really are so amazing that one ceases to pay any attention to what the film is about, and one just watches, mesmerized, as they interact with one another. they could be sitting and knitting or reciting the telephone book and it would barely matter. in this film, myrna loy finds 'the man she always thought was hidden inside' her husband and 'loves him again'. however, he then is hit on the head again. and i won't ruin anything by saying what happens next. one of my little hobbies is imitating the cooing of doves. i had not realized that william powell was there before me, but then i must not reveal too much about what he is cooing about, as it might not make it past the hays office.\",\n",

              " \"i actually had decent expectations for this one but found myself cringing throughout most of the film. there's really no goal in this movie. as i contemplated the hollow feeling of having wasted a couple hours watching the film, i switched from passive viewer into active reviewer mode to determine why htd didn't work on so many levels. first of all, i wanted to empathize with mandy moore's character, but there was nothing about her struggles that resonated at all. there was no growth pattern (aka character arc) to be found in her either; she was just a whining, disenchanted stereotype. moore's character is the caricature of the frustrated teen who doesn't want to risk being loved for fear of getting hurt. another factor that worked against the film was that they tried to cram too many subplots/characters in, and the main story did not benefit from most of that peripheral crap. let's see, we had the pregnant girlfried...the doper grandma...the father and his new wife...the mother and her new love interest...halley's aloof but totally undesirable hippie boyfriend...the sister and her fiance's socio-economic wranglings. it was headache-inducing fare to be sure. halley's love interest just kept popping up, never with a context or sense of why he was where he was. what did we know about the guy? nothing. we didn't observe his home life. didn't really learn his interests. he was simply inserted into different settings (parking lots, stores, backyards, etc.) as though required by movie convention. the few scenes that were probably intended to endear us to the loser, such as the funeral speech scene, were presented pathetically with no emotional weight whatsoever. third, the lazy writing for this film threw so much over-used tripe at us. for example, you know a film is struggling when they have a dog hump one of the principle character's legs. also, the dope-smoking grandma seemed such a tired bit as well. after those ridiculous and unfunny insertions, any attempts at serious drama in this schizophrenic film were greatly compromised. casting and chemistry were certainly some weak points of the film as well. my significant other and i agreed that mandy moore did not seem in any way conceivably to be a blood relative to the mother in the film. they looked nothing alike. granted, this is hard to gauge, but then i started to realize that other films pull this off very well. the lack of character change/growth and of any conceivable end goal also made any attempts to generate a conflict or climax to the film moot. toward the end when the boyfriend avoids her for a while, it was merely yawn-inducing. this is supposed to be tension? this is supposed to make me concerned? hardly. the film's efforts toward the end to generate some artificial excitement were particularly cloying and lame. in particular, when the boyfriend forced his way on to the radio station's air waves as though he had to do something desperate and gritty to get halley's attention, i wondered why he hadn't thought to simply go to her house or call her on the phone. there was no indication that he had made any other more reasonable attempts to contact her. therefore, what could have been a sweet moment, came off as a stunt and portrayed the love interest as a buffoon and social retard.<br /><br />i can only hope that mandy finds better vessels for her talent in the future. churning out garbage like this will do nothing for her reputation and continued employment in the film industry.\",\n",

              " 'in what may be the most remarkable live action film to come out of the disney studios during the 80\\'s or even the 70\\'s for that matter, i find the treatment it has received from it\\'s own studio appalling. the best thing i can compare it to is having a ruby but discarding it because you only prefer diamonds. considering all the costume jewelry disney released in the aforementioned decades, you would think they would have more respect for this gem.<br /><br />i\\'m sure parents who took their children to see natty gann when it was released were surprised and shocked to discover that it was not a film for younger children. it is a very dark realistic film which takes place during the great depression. this is not only the story of a young girl traveling across country to find her father, it is the story of people searching for hope and trying to survive in an age when just having food on the table was a constant struggle.<br /><br /> when natty\\'s father sol(ray wise) is offered a job in a logging camp in washington, he is only given a few hours to come to a decision, either take the job and leave natty behind, or stay in chicago with natty and hopefully find work elsewhere. at first, rejecting the job offer, he steps out into the chicago streets. in a truly remarkable scene, we see as sol does, the faces of all those who have lost hope and been beaten down in despair. it is after this brief but telling moment that he realizes, as we do, there is no decision to be made and sol accepts the work in seattle. sol is forced to leave natty in the care of a boarding house owner connie(lainie kazan). after natty overhears connie reporting her as an abandoned child, she decides not to wait for her father to send for her, and begins an arduous journey across country to find him.<br /><br />if ever there was a film that is a picture of contrasts it\\'s this one. early in the film we are given the harsh reality of depression era chicago. director jeremy kagan does not spare us from the details. we watch as men stand hopelessly and helplessly praying and hoping for work. there is a scene where a destitute family are evicted from their home. later, as sol is heading to washington in the bus, we see another family on the road with their meager belongings strapped to their car as they head west, their car no longer operable. as natty walks through the market place vendors sell what meager belongings they have just to get buy. when natty runs away we see her fishing for food out of a trash can for a morsel to consume. later, as natty travels westward, there is beautifully photographed scenery of forests and mountains, but director kagan astutely reminds us of the bleakness of the depression with many scenes of the struggle in rural america, ranging from a scene of a farmer and his much pregnant wife plowing a field, to scenes of orphaned and abandoned children left to be wards of the state. this is not your daddy\\'s disney, kids. dick bush\\'s cinematography of the wilderness is breathtaking, yet in the scenes set in chicago and in the farm towns of america, he mutes his colors to enhance the contrast between beauty and desperation. <br /><br />when natty jumps her first train, she is help and befriended by harry(john cusack), who is also riding the rails. cusack in his first major dramatic role after being extremely good in the sure thing, shows for the first time that he is not just a comedic actor, but has dramatic prowess as well. harry may be young, but cusack gives him the edge of a man aged beyond his years. it is an uncanny performance.<br /><br />salenger, as natty, is more than just a teenage actress. her characterization draws us into the story from the first moments of this film to the last. it is the key that holds this film together and if it had been put into less capable hands the film would surely not have succeeded as well. although her film career since natty gann has not been noteworthy, you will always remember her for her unflinching portrayal of natty gann. this is a journey for the ages, and one you will not soon forget. unfortunately.......<br /><br />i don\\'t make it a habit to comment on the dvd release of films, but in this case i\\'ll make an exception. the transfer of this wonderful film is appalling. it\\'s bad enough when a film that shouts \\\\wide screen\\\\\" is only released in a very horrid poorly done pan and scan, but the full screen transfer is one of the worst if not the worst i have ever seen. it gives new meaning to the word grainy. at times the picture jitters so that you may begin reaching for your vcr remote to adjust the tracking until you remember this is a dvd. there are signs of the film\\'s age running rampant throughout and no visible effort to clean it up digitally or otherwise. i\\'m not one to believe every film should come with a boatload of extras, and have no problem if a studio wants to give us just the film, but there is absolutely no excuse for the poor picture quality of this dvd. this movie is a gem, and for the disney studios to tarnish it and treat it in this unconscionable manner, saddens me terribly. what is more frustrating is the fact that disney can do quality video releases, so just a decent film to dvd wide screen transfer would not have been a lot to ask for. they should be ashamed of what they have done to this fine fine film.<br /><br />my grade: journey of natty gann-a<br /><br />dvd transfer - f <br /><br />\"',\n",

              " 'la mujer de mi hermano is a bad movie that manages, through stylish visuals, neat transitions, lush electronica used as mood music, and a deliberate plot pacing, to look better than it is. story-wise, it would have been better off set anywhere between the fifties, because technically it\\'s akin to the much better far from heaven in melodrama, or even when this type of movies came into vogue during the period going from the late seventies into the early nineties. how and why it\\'s situated in the present, and even more so, that its story got through the datedness that bogs it down is a mystery, but then again, latin america is still in a mire of its own ultra-conservative values -- men are supposed to be macho; women who take charge of their own life are seen as little more than \\\\zorras\\\\\" in heat, and everything happens in a very hush-hush way. so for a latin american public, the premise of la mujer de mi hermano may work perfectly; on the other hand, it falls into an ugly \\\\\"splat!\\\\\" of epic proportions on this side of the rio grande.<br /><br />much of it has nothing to do with its denouement, which to a degree may even then be somewhat forgivable. its failing, and achilles heel, is based squarely in the trite language -- both on a visual and written level -- that tries to tell an intelligent story but has nothing to hold on to. for example, we\\'re told that ignacio and zoe have been married for ten years, and that\\'s okay. what is not, and where the story\\'s implausibilities begin to show, is that in those ten years, they\\'ve fallen into a predictability where ignacio can only have sex on saturdays and prefers business traveling than being with zoe. ten years is a long, long time for zoe not to notice the 500 pound elephant sitting placidly in her sleek, minimalistic and uber-contemporary living room. maybe it\\'s those twenty grapes she has a penchant for. then again, dorothy parker wrote a story called \\\\\"too bad\\\\\", where a married couple of seven years suddenly separated. no one knew why, but once we went inside the marriage, we saw that these two had absolutely nothing in common, not even enough for small talk. we never find out their mechanics, but it\\'s still a pretty funny story.<br /><br />this, however, is a story that takes itself seriously. adding to the fact that ignacio and zoe have strange marital arrangements is the presence of ignacio\\'s studly brother gonzalo. gonzalo and ignacio are estranged as presented in exclamation points early on at a family lunch. zoe, do-gooder that she is, contacts gonzalo and tries to make amends. he sells her a painting, and ignacio hits the ceiling. fifteen minutes are spent mulling and arguing over this painting as if it had some symbolic meaning. no sooner than this happens that zoe is confiding deep secrets to gonzalo as if she\\'d known him all her life, and a phone conversation implausibly makes its way to ignacio\\'s ears, but all he can do is throw the darned painting into the pool and seethe. more unremarkable events take place: zoe also confides in who we\\'re led to believe is her best friend, boris, a stereotypical nellie. conversations between zoe and boris are built to make us understand more will come out of their friendship, but that doesn\\'t happen. the same can be said when zoe makes gonzalo prove to her he hasn\\'t had sex with other women, or when in a repeat scene, she makes ignacio promise her he hasn\\'t had sex with men. it\\'s all tease and fake promise.<br /><br />so with all this teasing going on, it\\'s not a surprise as to why la mujer de mi hermano looks good, but is quite bad. it begins with the misnomer of its title which would have gonzalo the main narrator of the story, and ends by its sheer quaintness that never decides where it wants to take its characters and leaves them muddled in its telenovela roots. at least for a debut film from ricardo de montreuil, it\\'s not a flat-out failure. it sells glossy images, attractive leads that would be at home in daytime soap, the presence of a veteran actress (angelica aragon), and that\\'s all there is to it.\"',\n",

should they go back to earth? eventually their satellite\\'s computer is hijacked by an unseen entity who prompts an impromptu landing somewhere near the coast of canada, sparking the second of the two b movie scenarios that becomes a post apocalyptic thriller centered around a makeshift totalitarian regime dominated by the prep school brat of an army general who recruits other brats, arms them with machine guns, and herds the surviving populace into a ramshackle town comprised mostly of junk. <br /><br />one of the astronauts encounters a survivalist hilariously played over the top by veteran character actor maury chaykin, who steals all of his scenes with a blase attitude (\\\\\"just get in your rocket ship and fly off to central america.\\\\\"), his home made converted front end loader tank contraption, and a kilt. he also has a teenage schoolgirl boarded up in his basement, the less said about which the better. his character is the only one in the film who emerges as an actual person, and when the story shifts it\\'s emphasis away from his fate it looses that central core of interest. in any event the astronaut strikes up a deal with the survivalist for the space capsule\\'s food supply and the female astronaut still on board, leading to their capture by the renegades and a series of bizarre scenes of social chaos that seem to have been inspired by spaghetti westerns.<br /><br />i will admit that the film is a bit of a mish-mash, and hard to keep track of because it changes gears so quickly. at one minute it\\'s a high tech space thriller, the next a grim survivalist tale, then social satire and finally a big, stupid shootout. but in all fairness it\\'s only the final twenty minutes or so that loose their footing in absurdity, with the main detraction being the role of the army brat dictator kid, who\\'s grip on the surviving populace is never fully explained. why are the others following his lead? since nobody bothers to tell the audience, the kid remains a caricature rather than a character, and the final conflict between the astronaut and him remains something of a contrivance rather than a believable series of events. the ending is also annoyingly empty of any kind of meaning at all, with the movie more or less simply being over at some point. you know, whatever.<br /><br />but if anything the movie has actually gotten more poignant over the decades since it\\'s creation: we now live in a world where middle eastern fanatics do indeed shape global events & have shown themselves capable of inflicting apocalyptic events. we\\'ve also seen events like the aftermath of hurricane katrina where social order has completely broken down, resulting in the kind of mind boggling escapades depicted in the latter part of the film. it\\'s no longer just an escapist nightmare/fantasy to suggest that what is being depicted in the film might actually happen, and the filmmakers should indeed be congratulated for pretty much getting the look of the apocalypse right ... though i do think that people would have found more opportunities to wash their faces & would think that ammunition for firearms would be a bit more of a rarity.<br /><br />the long and short of it is that def-con 4 is not the unwatchable disaster that many might have potential viewers believe. it\\'s a grim, grimy, somewhat distasteful endeavor for sure, but then again so was the prospect nuclear combat toe to toe with the ruskies. don\\'t knock the film for having more or less gotten the aspect of what that might mean correctly.<br /><br />7/10\"',\n",

              " \"i've always been a fan of european cinema, mostly because it has something more to offer than hollywood's mass production. don't think that i hate every movie that comes from hollywood or that i love all european films. as well in europe as in america, they have made some excellent movies as well as awful ones. <br /><br />if it isn't a better story or more profound characters, than it is the style of filming that makes european cinema a little different from the american. and this movie has it all. the story is very good and original and the characters are very recognizable. i really got the feeling that i got to know them better, even though their lives are sometimes completely different from mine. but most important is the way everything is shot. for those who aren't familiar with the rules made up by dogma yet, i'll give a small explanation: the director promises not to use extra light, special effects, extra sound effects... they want to make the story speak for itself and show everything in a natural and realistic way. to some this may seem like the most boring concept ever. i guess many people who like movies like the lord of the rings, star wars, spiderman,... movies that are full of special effects, huge scenes and nice visual effects, may not be blown away by this movie. i know that many people may hate the concept, that many people don't want to see this kind of movies, but personally i find this a very welcome concept in a world where everybody seems to feel the need to copy what works, without being original.<br /><br />kresten has moved from a small danish island, where his parents farm is, to copenhagen in order to pursue an excellent career and unconcerned life. he marries his boss's daughter and is sure that he'll become the new boss as soon as his father-in-law decides to retire. but on his honeymoon he gets a phone call that his father died and that he'll have to return home. the only problem is that he has never told his wife that he had a father and a retarded brother, living together on the family farm. once he arrives at the farm, he sees that much hasn't changed or been done since he left and he decides that they will need a housekeeper to clean up the mess. he sends an advertisement to a local newspaper and he immediately gets a reaction from liva psilander. liva is a prostitute who wants to start a new life. she wants to escape from an anonymous psychopath who harasses her by phone and needs a lot of money to pay her brother bjarke's school tuition. when kresten's wife discovers the truth, or at least what she thinks the truth is, she breaks off the marriage and makes sure that kresten will lose his job at her father's company and that he'll never get it back. now kresten will have to live together with his brother, with livia and her little brother in the old farm on the island...<br /><br />i can assure you that you'll have to get used to the way of filming at first. perhaps you'll need two viewings to fully appreciate this movie, but once you can see past the style of filming, you'll see that this movie has a very beautiful and hearth warming subject. personally i really liked it and that's why i give this movie at least an 8/10, even an 8.5/10.\",\n",

              " 'when rankin and bass unveiled their version of tolkien\\'s \\\\the hobbit\\\\\" in 1977, it was a charming if abbreviated made-for-television animated film that was fun and even a bit scary. their voice casting choices were fine, especially richard boone, whose cancer-rasped voice brought the dragon smaug to life, and theodore as the creepy and loathsome gollum, who evoked fear and disgust but little pity. in 1978, ralph bakshi attempted to bring the first half of \\\\\"the lord of the rings\\\\\" trilogy to the big screen in his lushly animated epic. unfortunately, his big-budget film flopped, much to the disappointment of tolkien\\'s fans, and bakshi would be unable to make his sequel. in an effort to finish off the unfinished series, rankin and bass tried to make their own version to satisfy the audience who wanted to see closure. it was and remains an unmitigated disaster.<br /><br />why is this cartoon so awful? well, the answer lies mainly in the word \\\\\"cartoon\\\\\". unlike the hobbit, which featured beautifully painted scenery that evoked delicate watercolors and ethereal linework, which had so evidently been crafted with loving care and cast with thought to matching characters to actors, the return of the king had all the earmarks of having been hastily cobbled together. it wasn\\'t so much an animated homage to a great writer\\'s work as a hatchet job. a huge chunk of the events in tolkien\\'s books were missing between where bakshi\\'s fairly faithful rendition ended and this abomination began. the drawings were slapped together and were often repetitious and ugly. voice actors from the first film returned and some of them worked: orson bean was fine as frodo, theodore was again great as gollum, theodore bikel did a fine job as aragorn, and roddy mcdowall was wonderful as samwise gamgee. the rest were abysmal. instead of hiring actors to do the characters, cartoon voice actors such as don messick (scooby-doo) and casey kasem (shaggy) were cast. it was downright painful to hear a nazgull being done by scooby doo through a distortion filter. many characters integral to tolkien\\'s story were cast away: where was gimli? faromir? any of the elves (other than elrond) such as legolas or glorfindel? how about the army of the dead or sauroman? merry and pippin didn\\'t develop as characters; gollum remained merely vile, as if bakshi\\'s attempts to show this tortured being\\'s strangely noble and pathetic side never happened. the dialog was stilted and sometimes unintentionally hilarious (\\\\\"as the flag\\'s standard broke the wind. . .\\\\\"). it was awful beneath description from beginning to end, appearing to be a shameless attempt to cash in on the hopes of frustrated fans who\\'d wanted the second animated movie made.<br /><br />that, of course, was the entire problem. this cartoon was, despite its trappings and claims, just a cartoon, less charming by far than the hobbit and far less noble than bakshi\\'s film. both of those were honest attempts at creating art, and each succeeded in its limited way until swept aside by peter jackson, who finally gave tolkien\\'s opus the treatment it deserved. the two earlier films merit a place of honor for trying to achieve cinematic beauty. rankin and bass\\'s the return of the king deserves to simply be forgotten.\"',\n",

              " 'a much longer version of this is on myspace.<br /><br />the documentary is what if the south had won the civil war, but it is actually a thinly disguised ruse on the part of lee and director kevin willmott to inculcate into the minds of the viewers that whites are racist by nature. <br /><br />throughout this insidious piece of trash, historical content is contently twisted and in serious question, as if they figure anyone dumb enough to eat this propaganda will not have much of an educational background to spot the discrepancies in historical facts. they might be able to pull the new timeline crap in a new star trek movie but it doesn\\'t work when we\\'re talking about a new history of the united states. the show goes through an overview of the history of the the csa from 1860 to the present. there is the spanish american war where this new american invades mexico. scratching your head yet? did it ring a bell yet? if you said mexican wasn\\'t involved in the spanish american war because they were no longer a part of spain you win the cookie. so we invade mexican, annex the country, and then enslave the mexican people. we couldn\\'t even catch one bandit named pancho villa down there in 1917 and these people who made this what if movie think that we could conquer and rule mexico we might have beaten .mexico in the 1847-48 mexico war, but to occupy and rule the county is another war, and one we would have unlikely won. the insurgency that would have followed would have lasted decades, especially since we intended to make the mexican people slaves. however, let alone mexico, this documentary has us conquering and ruling south america, too and enslaving those people. ruling counties like the british empire did is one thing and could very well have worked (since the british didn\\'t turn the people into slaves), but when you enslave the people, you fuel the embers that heat the fire insurgency. rule them maybe, enslave an entire country without dire consequences, fantasy. ..<br /><br />one sequence of the film shows abraham lincoln being exiled into canada. in a filmed interview of lincoln in 1905, he ponders on how he wished he could have helped the blacks gain their freedom. i guess the spike lee and willmott are unaware that sound movies were not invented until 1918 and not commercially used until 1920, usually little two minute news clips. <br /><br />the last segment shows the election of richard nixon and john kennedy. (that those two would still be candidates after all these timeline changes or that there are elections at all in such a country is truly mind boggling). i think the election it\\'s to show democracy as racist and evil. nixon is shown to be the pro slave racist (we all know that republicans are all racists, right- see lincoln the republican) and kennedy is shown to the emancipator trying to stop slavery. and the assassination (which once again, in the real timeline, was tied to oswald\\'s trip to russia and his being a communist- no cold war with russia, remember?) is shown to be a conspiracy to keep america in slavery. after this, the revolt by black americans (this timeline\\'s version of the civil rights movement) is put down. there are innuendos in this part as the black insurgents are called terrorists by the media, and a black commentator from europe says something like \\\\one person\\'s terrorist is another person\\'s freedom fighter, a reference to today\\'s war on terror and a back door way of displaying sympathy for today\\'s terrorists who attacked america on 911- a very clever attack by lee and willmott on their own country. later, we see ronald reagan as a strong supporter of slavery. <br /><br />throughout this bad piece of liberal and racist propaganda are what if tv commercials, showing white people selling products that all have a heavy derogatory slam against black people, insulting both their intelligence and humanity. however, these commercials have another motive, an insidious motive that labels white people as natural born racists, and vilifies whites as the oppressors of the world. to imply that blacks can\\'t be racist but whites can is a form of racism that is as bad as any jim crow law. <br /><br />i could probably go on but i\\'ve made my point. spike lee is a racist. he hates white people and wants to vilify them and show them to be inherently evil, which is racist. hitler did a similar thing when he made documentaries showing the jewish people to be sneaky, perfidious, and greedy.\"',\n",

wasn\\'t he new to the picture as well? who gave mike epps\\' character permission to be the designated older bro of kenya? i didn\\'t believe it. just more time to saturate the characters, making their efforts seem that much more irrelevant.<br /><br />downside: kenya\\'s friends are these supposed success stories, but they sound like dashieky and them on the corner. i know plenty of educated sisters and their so used to \\\\\"reeling it in\\\\\" that you\\'ll never hear them talk that ignorant, talking about \\\\\"having big head kidz\\\\\" and all that bull. they were talking crazy in the back office of a synagogue during a jewish wedding, very loud and \\\\\"ghetto.\\\\\" i didn\\'t believe it for a single second.<br /><br />oh, it gets better.<br /><br />downside: now let\\'s all agree that blair underwood\\'s character came off as the supposed \\\\\"i.b.m.\\\\\" educated, handsome, successful, whatever, right? kenya had even expressed to the people close to her how great he was. then why would the writer and director allow his character to totally go left only to make the crisis that much more easier for kenya? why would they bring down the value of the telling by making him become that superficial, weirdo that we all love to dislike? doesn\\'t that make the right choice blatantly obvious for kenya? it was an easy way out and it wasn\\'t even believable. it would\\'ve worked better if blair underwood were still a great guy until the end, exemplifying the patience, sincerity and charming qualities that made brian the winner, and then some. it would\\'ve worked better if blair underwood\\'s character were beyond competition for brian, allowing kenya to make the hard choice to follow her heart, regardless of how she would make \\\\\"white\\\\\" look \\\\\"right.\\\\\" those are the best love stories, when a man or woman has to choose between two great people, leaving them no choice but to follow their hearts. wouldn\\'t that had made a bigger statement? and why did kenya feel the need to bring brian back to the cotillion in that mexican suit? could both the writer and director have made us see how much kenya accepts brian for who he is no matter what her friends and family say in a different, more profound way? it killed the film. now she has something to prove. pity. and she\\'s using poor brian to prove it.<br /><br />memo to the writer and director: \\\\\"back to the drawing board with this one.\\\\\" memo to oprah: \\\\\"you need to stick to talking about nothing rather than what films are good. let\\'s not forget beloved the countless other films you had put your stamp of approval on; white chicks, diary of a mad black woman, madea\\'s family reunion, crash and many, many more.\\\\\"\"',\n",

              " \"this is an exceptional film - not because most of the critics say so, but for me because i cannot think of any other film which left me with a greater feeling of having been temporarily transported to another world in a place and time with which i was totally unfamiliar.<br /><br />many imdb users have reviewed and commented on this film and another full review is unnecessary, but bringing out its exceptional nature and encouraging those who have not seen it to do so does require some supplementation. comments about the nudity in this film not being disturbing come into this category. today nudity occurs in films for two principal reasons, firstly because it would be natural for the character concerned under the circumstances being depicted by the film, or secondly because it is being used by the director to add a little eye candy intended to increase the visual appeal of the film. in the latter case the viewers personal reaction will govern the response to such eye candy, (typically for example, regardless of whether or not they themselves appreciate it, many viewers feel that this is very inappropriate for younger viewers and all films should provide advance warning when it is present). but where the nudity is an integral part of the story being presented, viewers who wish to see this story should not find it disturbing unless the nude scenes are excessive or gross. pretty baby is not such a film, it is one where louis malle has minimized his use of nudity - any less and the nature and character of the scenario he has to depict could become distorted. he should be commended on his restraint which may have made it much easier for some viewers to concentrate on the more serious issues raised in the film.<br /><br />when this film was first released the sequence showing the brothel auctioning the virginity of their new girl to the highest bidder raised a lot of eyebrows, and clearly many in the audiences had not appreciated that this practice used to be commonplace. most viewers found the sequence disturbing, but in pretty baby the fact that violet had been raised to expect this, and was looking forward to it as an important step towards entering adult life, greatly reduced its impact. another film, french quarter, which was released the same year as pretty baby, was the story of an orphaned girl who had been strictly brought up on a farm, but who had had to take refuge in a city brothel to avoid starvation when her parents died. those who saw it will remember that it included a similar auction which i for one found much more harrowing to watch as it clearly showed the trauma inflicted on an unprepared and very reluctant young girl, starting of course as she was being stripped and paraded for public exhibition. any such sequences provide very uncomfortable viewing for most men, who tend to thankfully take refuge in a conviction that they could never occur today.<br /><br />other scenes showing the exploitation inherent in life as it was lived in storyville in 1917 were also found to be disturbing by many viewers; and some comments even suggest a widely held conviction that we live in a more moral society today. before we condemn our forbears we should perhaps examine this conviction in more detail. in europe and north america we have quite recently moved away from a society where marriages among the upper classes were regarded as primarily intended to enhance social status and generate offspring. wives frequently did not love their husbands and, although they dutifully provided children, they were often happy for him to exercise his virility with paid companions. visits to a local brothel, where regular customers could became friendly with all the staff, were condoned or even approved. this often led to a reasonably stable environment for the young women concerned. today most of us would strongly disapprove of such lifestyles, and would rightly emphasize how far we have progressed by ensuring young people have the opportunity to choose their own lifetime partner; but we still need to be honest about the problems this new lifestyle has created today. there were few robert pickton's feeding twenty-six victims to his pigs in victorian times. today we frequently encounter police warnings about serial killers; in victorian times jack the ripper was a much more unique character. too many of today's prostitutes shiver in the rain or snow on street corners throughout long evenings each night, periodically spending an infrequent few uncomfortable minutes in a car - each time at an unknown risk to themself - and are forced afterwards to give almost all their takings to a pimp attached to the local street gang. we need to recognize that many of them would probably regard living in a comfortable and stable brothel, such as that depicted in this film, as akin to heaven on earth.<br /><br />ultimately this is the powerful message from pretty baby that makes it such an exceptional film; but because the director decided to employ a totally non-judgmental documentary type presentation and to minimise any direct emotional appeal, most viewers probably only recognize it when scenes returned to their memory during the hours and days after they left the cinema, and i do not believe its rare combination of beautiful imagery and haunting power has so far been brought out adequately by the comments on this database.\",\n",

              " \"for the particular movie fan, the beat that my heart skipped, is a slice of intensity, wonder, and subtlety that can only come from europe. the director/co-writer, jacques audiard, has taken a film previously made by james toback called fingers, starring harvey keitel in the role now occupied by romain duris, and made it his own. if i had seen the original version i would make a couple of comparisons to it (at the least, for those who didn't see the original the remake makes you want to check out the original, if only for the acting appeal of keitel). however i did think about another wonderful french film in the vein of this film- francois truffaut's shoot the piano player.<br /><br />while truffaut's film is a little more concerned about the lead's relationship(s) with women, i felt a kind of connection between the material of the two pieces- sometimes intense, usually lyrical, tales of a person trying to find what fits more for them, the more criminal side, or the artistic side. and, much like truffaut and his other new-wave counterparts, audiard successfully takes an american formula picture and forms it well into a french setting.<br /><br />there are a few reasons to recommend the movie, one would be for the music, which gives repeated but specific renditions of a bach tune. another would be just for the technical-side, which is well-done in hand-held, neo-noir style by stephane fontaine. another could even just be for how audiard tells his story, or sometimes doesn't tell it: a couple of times mid-way through the film, i wondered if the story of this character would 'go' anywhere, which can either make or break a film of this kind. it pleasantly (or intensely) did, bringing a catharsis for a viewer by the final scenes.<br /><br />but likely for most the prominent reason would be for the realistic acting, in particular by its star duris. as i said, i can't make comparisons between a heavyweight like keitel and duris (whom i've never seen in a film before this), but on his own terms duris creates his character believably. it's at times a complex character, or sometimes not- he has that kind of attitude and face where you don't know whether he's really a 'street-level' guy or more straight laced. the split that is also apparent in the character's parents, one a classic pianist who's passed on (the mother), and the other a more criminal-type of a father, also gives the film an added boost of psychological energy. the lead in this film, much like with the storytelling (or lack of it), dictates how it may turn out.<br /><br />in the end, audiard and duris make it compelling enough for the film to be about him, his conflicts, his lusts, his music. it's a wonderful movie that seems to have passed under the radar (it's in only a few theaters around the area) amid other independent summer fare, but if you're an enthusiast of character-driven thrillers that give a bitter-sweet edge, it's a must-see.\",\n",

              " \"the last time i saw this film must have been nearly fifteen years ago. during that time, although i had forgotten the title entirely, there were aspects of this film that stuck in my brain and likely contributed to a few random dreams; i remember not really following the plot as a child, but i recalled finding it a) very beautiful, and b), unbelievably dark. certain scenes and characters have stayed with me with dogged persistence---a swarm of jellyfish that seem to electrocute or burn their victims to death rather than poisoning them; the deaths of two juvenile characters that hammer home the realization that, like in the film *cube*, every last character is expendable; and the image that probably haunted me most of all, the scene towards the end involving a forced cocooning that speaks volumes about parental coercion and a pigheaded refusal to see reason. many reviewers have compared the story to romeo & juliet, and although i wouldn't have understood the analogy as a child, i'm sure i recall the realization that, however majestic and omnipotent the combatants (sea and fire, in this case), the conflict presented is nothing more than a childish feud, a pointless and senseless sparring match that will probably never see a true victory. pretty disturbing themes for a film allegedly for children! now that i have recently rediscovered the title(s), i would greatly enjoy finding this film again, if only for old time's sake. it's rare that a film leaves such a long impression on me, and for all those out there who also were touched by this film, i'd recommend it in a double billing with martin rosen's *watership down*, a similarly lovely and chilling animation.\",\n",
              " \"x-men is my favourite comic book series, i have been a fan of the comic books and the animated series in the 90s and i was excited when i found out that they were making an x-men film. i was round 14/15 at the time it was released and the only bad thing about my experience seeing the film was the popcorn (american can't make sweets to save their lives).<br /><br />x-men is a wide ranging series which tackles a lot of plots and issues. it has been considered to be a metaplor for the civil rights movement in the 60s and the comics have tackled other issues like the role of the government, the aids virus and the holocaust. there is also the issue that powers may be a curse rather then a blessing e.g. rogue and cyclops. there are also a number of characters and fractions which would have made the film difficult to make because there would have been no way to make the fans 100% happy.<br /><br />the plot of the film is in the world they are mutants, people with powers that can range from being psychic to changing your apparent to healing to controlling the weather. they are met with fear from the general public and they are calls in the us senate for the mutant regisration act, to get details of every mutant in the usa. within the mutant community there are two major factors, the x-men and the brotherhood of mutants. the x-men, led by charles xavier, want to have harmonious relations with humanity whilst the brotherhood, led by erik lehnsherr/magento, believes that the human race would never accept mutants and that a war is coming. in the middle of this are two mutants, wolverine (hugh jackman) and rogue (anna paqulin). wolverine can not remember his past and lives a nomadic lifestyle and rogue is a teenage runaway, who needly kills her boyfriend just by kissing him. mangento wants rogue so he can complete his scheme to turn the world's leaders in mutants.<br /><br />this film was not particular action packed; this was because the budget was $75 million which is nothing special for a summer blockbuster, and the director was bryan singer, who's most famous film before was the usual suspects, a psychology crime thriller. he chose to focus on character development which was a good move. he also tackled the project as an outsider, he was not a fan of the comics, but i thought that was good because he was able to cut of the flak. he made the film into a realistic sci-fi film which could appeal to the fans and normal movie goers. he made a few jokes about some of the issues of the comics, like the codenames and the costumers. the film does tackles ideas like wolverine's tortured past and his rivalry with cyclops, xavier's friendship with his rival magneto, the human factor, wolverine's need to protect children, the list goes on. the film also has a good international cast, patrick stewart, sir ian mckellon, halle berry, famke janssen, james marsden and anna paquin. the film also made hugh jackman into an overnight star because before the film he was an australian stage actor and after it he became an a-lister and has a strong scene of loyalty to the franchise. to a lesser extent rebecca romjin has also become a major actress.<br /><br />the film isn't perfect, i would have liked to have seen more characters like gambit and beast, and the film did ignore wolverine's and sabretooth's hatred for each other and the fact that they have a past together. x-men was an introduce to the film franchise, especially to people who do not know the comics.<br /><br />x-men is a very good film, x-men 2 is even better and x-men 3 was one of my most biggest film disappointments. i would love to see bryan singer back in the director's chair and ignore the third film and do it the way he wants and the fans want.\",\n",

um, did anyone actually see any tracks when the teens were roaming around, going in all kinds of directions, rooms, etc? though in the prologue the car seemed to have a direct route, some overhead shots showed fog trying to hide that there were really no tracks. even though bill warned a gal to watch out for the tracks (much later, at that), you could clearly see on the floor there weren\\'t any, and while they went into other rooms there was no logic to the place, no real directional way that the tracks would be able to take a car around in them. there were plenty of shots of things hanging and dropping down, dummies popping up nowhere near where the ride would have been going....you get the idea. it was a set that was a bunch of walls, halls, and stairs that didn\\'t have any use. lots of fog too to make the set look more busy. while jim (dufus guy) was in the basement trying to fix the power later, there was no reason electrically powered dummies and items would be there in the first place. oh, yeah, actually just for the camera to show a close-up of to fill in time and \\\\\"scares.\\\\\"<br /><br />surprises?

              " 'this movie was paced so slowly that even snails would be saying \\\\hello, i\\'d like to get there sometime today!\\\\\" the best part of the movie is where this chef in a restaurant goes after someone with a cleaver. after that it goes downhill from there. so yeah, there\\'s a conspiracy to forward the cause of bad films everywhere. i had to watch the ending a couple of times because i kept nodding off. if you are suffering from insomnia, pop this movie in and start watching it. it worked so well,that i almost got fired for sleeping on the job. if you want to see a better movie starring david janssen, go watch moon of the wolf. in fact, the only reason i saw this movie was because it was on a dvd with moon of the wolf. it was in a bargain bin at a walgreens near where i work. the sticker price was one dollar. it was one of those dvd\\'s that are out there that are packaged in one of those slim jewel cases, and the dvd is double sided (a movie on both sides). although i was surprised to see that ray milland starred in this movie. if you want to see a ray milland movie that\\'s better, go watch frogs. it has him and sam elliot.\"',\n",
              " 'mèxico, being an almost 100% catholic country produced several nunsploitation flicks in the 70\\'s. before censorship took a big role in mexican movies, there were many, many exploitation flicks for different tastes. i must admit that this isn\\'t a masterpiece by any means, but it is a movie that deserves a chance and will please fans of gore and sleaze. <br /><br />many mexicans tend to easily \\\\scare\\\\\" with plots like the one in \\\\\"satànico pandemonium\\\\\" because it deals with two restricted topics in mexican society : sex and religion nastiness. <br /><br />\\\\\"satànico pandemonium\\\\\" does not rank high on the exploitation heaven but it manages to deliver quality intense violence and disturbing images for those who enjoy this kind of cinema. the language used in this movie is macabre and it\\'s very relevant for the plot. if you speak spanish you might enjoy it more than if you watch it with sub-titles because most of the words have no exact literal translation.<br /><br />the raw acting is a key factor in the movie. for example, the afro american nun that cries all over the convent because of her depression for being black is something that may seem random; you just watch her cry and suffer. the scene takes relevance as the plot develops (she\\'s \\\\\"aided\\\\\" by sister maria who convinces her to commit suicide).<br /><br />many situations like that one make you think \\\\\"where\\'s the coherence with these mexican film makers?\\\\\" but that\\'s just to add tension. also, the convent is very creepy mainly because of a great art direction. the atmosphere in the convent is sinister and the fact that the devil is prowling outside, makes it even more a scary place. i praise the cinematography because the movie is visually stunning. the events take place at noon at night and the movie still looks sinister.<br /><br />the music is also convincing and very disturbing. the director knows how to create a disturbing, scary setting with the correct use of light, sounds, and suspense. the acting is not that good because most of the main actresses were amateur, except for pezet who delivers a brave, solid performance. she\\'s a beautiful woman with nerves. she was perfect for the role because she\\'s extremely pretty, has an angel face; the perfect prey for satan. she deserved more leading roles in her career. too bad that this was her last movie. she was just too beautiful to be involved in nunsploitation flicks! veteran t.v. and movie actor enrique rocha gives a strong performance as the devil and his voice is scary alone. he was great. the rest of the cast is just plain and dull. <br /><br />the movie goes directly to the point immediately after it starts. after the opening credits, satan seduces sister mary and then the horror starts immediately. she is tempted in several scenes, and finally, when she falls into satan\\'s tramp, she starts a rampage of sex and murder. thank you! <br /><br />maybe europeans aren\\'t easily scared with topics like the devil seducing or torturing nuns,but here in mèxico it\\'s a different deal. the devil is by far the scariest character in mèxican culture. now, if you mix him with religion (which is something very delicate here) you have a terrifying experience. in the first minutes there is auto flagellation (good gore) , lesbian nun sex, and satan. mèxico created this interesting premise which sadly, in the 80\\'s and 90\\'s was heavily banned because of a censorship campaign against violence in cinema. i\\'m glad that these movies get dvd releases for europe so they can recognize the country\\'s talent in horror. <br /><br />the main problem with this movie is the lack of continuity and coherence in the plot. first, we only know that the movie takes place in the inquisition times because of the tombs of the nuns. so, the movie is set in the mid 1600\\'s. then, what should we realize about the ending? it\\'s too easy to blame the devil! but it does no makes sense. <br /><br />anyways, \\\\\"satanico pandemonium\\\\\" has become somewhat a cult nunsploitation movie; it was even referenced in \\\\\"from dusk till dawn\\\\\". the weak point of the movie is that it hasn\\'t aged very well. the veteran director is heavily influenced by classic theater techniques and acting and does not gives a dynamic mood to the movie. the camera angles are boring at some points, and some events truly last longer than they should. for example, when sister maria takes care of the sick cow, or when she realizes she\\'s been tempted by the devil.<br /><br />at some point it looks like a very old horror movie but with lots of gore. talking about gore, the movie has two highlight gory scenes in my opinion. first, when sister maria seduces and later stabs marcelo to death. the scene is weird because it makes you wonder how would it be if a nun \\\\\"like that\\\\\" would seduce you, and later, it grosses you out. i felt sorry for marcelo\\'s tender grandmother. the other scene, is when sister maria is stabbed to death by the other nuns. the gore is great in this movie. expect stabs, self punishment, and a glorious flashback sequence involving the inquisition (excellent for those who like gore). <br /><br />mèxico is not all about raw, cheesy, gory flicks involving wrestlers, with no plot. mèxico had a huge potential in the genre but as many people know, politicians and constitutional presidents banned the rise of mexican exploitation. sure, it came back in the 80\\'s but not as a horror sub-genre; it came among low budget action movies and the typical valentìn trujillo flicks.<br /><br />give a try to \\\\\"satànico pandemonium\\\\\" because it offers blood, gore, a scary plot (for us who respect the religious factor), and a dark atmosphere. buy it for all of it\\'s goodies. i believe there\\'s an unrated version.\"',\n",

              " \"when audiences went to see the latest production of a tragedy by william shakespeare at the globe theatre, there was a universal reaction by the spectators to what they were seeing on the stage. it was one of sadness, anger, sympathy and relief. the sadness was normally due to the innocent victim (who was usually a beautiful woman) being murdered in an unjustified fashion, such as desdemona in 'othello'; the anger would have been directed towards the villain in the play whose dastardly deeds had resulted in the deaths of heroes and heroines - here we have iago, arguably the most evil character in the history of literature ('othello' again); sympathy was not for the devil, but for the poor people who had overcome the denouement but had to deal with its consequences (horatio perhaps in 'hamlet', or maybe father laurence in 'romeo and juliet'); and lastly relief was felt because the audience had survived the play's violence and could thank their lucky stars that they did not have to live in a world so cruel. now stay with me here, because there is, in fact, a point to all of this. i believe that fincher's 'seven' is the modern shakespearean tragedy, the modern 'titus andronicus', if you will. the feeling that washes over you when the credits roll in seven (which are damn good credits i might add, start and finish) is on a par with a great shakespearean tragedy, and it is for this reason why i think that films such as seven should be considered as more serious in a literary sense. not only that, but the film even introduces the audience to legendary texts such as dante's 'inferno' and geoffrey chaucer's 'the canterbury tales' - so i would be inclined to try and influence more english professors to watch this film. <br /><br />now here's the part where i say 'yeah seven, woo, it's awesome! yeah!'. i'm just going to go out and say it: this film has everything that you could possibly be looking for when watching a movie. the script, for one, is great. original, funny in places, exciting, sexy...the list is endless really. well played andrew kevin walker; the boy done good. next we have the acting which, to put in a romantic sense, is sublime: people may argue that morgan freeman can only play one character, but i think it's similar to the situation with hugh grant (his one persona may be a bumbling, lovable fool, but he is damn good at it) and it's the same for morgan. here he is at his fatherly, worldly-wise detective best, and the comic double act of freeman and pitt is essential to the film. pitt's performance is probably just about overshadowed by his portrayal of tyler durden in fincher's other chef d'oeuvre 'fight club', but in no way is this a demeaning statement to pitt. he is, or was, one of my favourite 'younger' actors (that's the ed norton, johnny depp ring, as opposed to the pacino/de niro/hoffman circle of expertise) until 2005 came about - ocean's 12, to put it mildly, disappointed me greatly. however, let's think positively: with seven and fight club and snatch, i'm sure brad has something in store for fans like me. gwyneth paltrow is probably the unsung hero, or heroine, of the film and ironically she's the one who gets it worst (or does she? refer back to tragedy point about sympathy). the words 'never better' spring to mind when thinking about paltrow's 'tracey'. there's someone else i'm not mentioning here, despite the 'contains spoiler' tick, but let's just say he/she/it provides, in my eyes, the greatest twist of all time. last but not least, david fincher is where it's at. his undoubtedly cool style is the reason why this film is so...cool, for want of a better word. thanks to him, morgan freeman is cool, gwyneth paltrow is cool, the man who works in that horrible place where the 'pride' crime takes place is cool, even the man/woman/thing with no name is cool (to a certain extent). <br /><br />to conclude, there are certain films that when the credits appear at the end, you think to yourself 'that has to be the best movie i've ever seen'. 'reservoir dogs' and 'l.a. confidential' are prime examples. in my opinion, 'seven' epitomises this type of film.\",\n",

              " 'this is a disturbing, bittersweet romantic comedy about two people who\\'s 15 year marriage is unraveling. actually, it is more of a romantic tragedy than a comedy. ben and katie jordan (bruce willis and michelle pfeiffer) are two mismatched people in the marriage that never should have been. he is spontaneous, romantic and impulsive, with low frustration tolerance and an explosive hair trigger temper. she is pragmatic, a compulsive perfectionist with unrealistic expectations, and a high need for control. she takes everything personally and never forgives or forgets a slight. they both blame each other for their disappointments. the pattern is clear. he doesn\\'t meet her standards so she snipes, he explodes and then she accuses him of not listening. she then throws up every mistake he\\'s ever made and every fault he\\'s ever had. this goes on ad nauseam as their romantic obsession with one another continues to get the best of any sense they might have to call it quits. like moths to a flame, they keep returning for another scorching. <br /><br />this film is thought provoking in that it portrays marital difficulties that are all too familiar in our society. the problem is that it tries to give every problem known to man (with the exception of wife beating) to this couple and relies on the single strand of a long forgotten romance to be the only chance of keeping them together.<br /><br />in watching the behind the scenes featurette on this film, rob reiner and writers alan zweibel and jessie nelson discuss how the story evolved. as it turns out, it was a montage of all their own marital problems. so the film was, in essence cathartic dumping ground for the writers and director.<br /><br />as filmmaking, it was terrific. rob reiner weaves the story together expertly, creating a stark contrast between the joy of the romance and the reality of the relationship. the film was punctuated by numerous funny and sweet moments that make the viewer smile and glow with delight.<br /><br />michelle pfeiffer gives a splendid performance of a very emotionally complex and neurotic character. it took a lot of courage for her to take this part because she was playing the least likeable character in the film, something of a departure for her. bruce willis was as good as one could have expected considering the fact that nobody was blowing anything up. actually, he was quite good as the impulsive, childlike romantic, but when it came to the arguments and the serious displays of resentment, he played the scenes too harshly, almost commando style.<br /><br />reiner does good camera work and puts together some good rapid fire scenes that have impact and give great insight into the relationship. he also took the film on location in venice to add a little romantic interlude, and somehow got eric clapton to write a great theme song.<br /><br />the problem is the story. reiner stated in the featurette that he intended this to be a realistic bittersweet look at the real problems relationships face. but he tried to do too much and made this film a grossly exaggerated caricature of a relationship in crisis. it is really \\\\the war of the roses\\\\\" lite only it takes itself too seriously. no one i know who saw this could believe that this couple could possibly have stayed married for 15 weeks, no less 15 years. <br /><br />the result is a noxious marathon of petty arguments that get under the viewers\\' skin after a while. it is about as entertaining as watching your best friends have a niggling argument in a public restaurant. the whole thing leaves you very uncomfortable and you don\\'t go home feeling like you\\'ve had a nice evening.<br /><br />so, while it succeeds as filmmaking, it fails as a film. i gave this film a 6/10. there were so many good elements to it that i can\\'t see trashing it. but the story is one that requires a level of emotional endurance that few viewers will be willing or able to invest to get any enjoyment out of it.<br /><br />\"',\n",

              " \"if this movie provides any insight into the chinese psyche, i'm worried. first off this is a kids movie with a cute little alien creature that a boy befriends. except the boy doesn't befriend him. he tries use him at first to get stuff, like good grades, and when the alien fails the alien is tortured, beaten, and thrown in the trash. for some reason, the alien returns to the boys home where he is further beaten and hit and thrown around. the alien decides to stay again. i am going to reveal the ending...the movie ends with the father being killed at an accident at work and the cute fuzzy alien thing sacrificing himself to resurrect the father. the only sense of the story i can make is that the creature was so despondent at being left in such a cruel miserable country he decided to kill himself by resurrecting the father. he resurrected the father because he wanted to punish him for being such a jerk by making him live longer at his sucky life as a poverty stricken coolie. <br /><br />and don't worry, the boy gets beaten too. great kids movie. want to know why china is one of the worst offenders when it comes to animal cruelty? here's one reason why.<br /><br />now i am no huge fan of disney/pixar/dreamworks, but at least the messages in their movies have a beautiful sentiment behind them. you know, friendship is important, love is important, etc etc. the message in this movie seems to be you can treat non-human living beings as horrible as you want, use them, dispose of them, and you will still be their master. if this is what passes for children's entertainment in china, then that is one messed up country.<br /><br />i should also mention, this movie is painfully unfunny. most american kids movies have a lot of clever things to keep adults entertained along with the young ones. like, for example, the use of led zeppelin's immigrant song in shriek iii. there is none of that in this movie. it is extremely dumbed down. but it won't work for kids either, as it can be upsetting to sensitive children.<br /><br />so, unless you are interested in a sociological examination of what constitutes a kid's movie from china, stay far away from this one. shaolin soccer isn't too bad though. i don't know where all the positive reviews came from either. i think it must be astroturfing by people who work for the studio.\",\n",
